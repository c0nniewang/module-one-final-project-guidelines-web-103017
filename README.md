## App Description

Beer Bud is your best friend when it comes to finding local breweries and beers! Beer Bud allows you to search for breweries by location (City and Zip Code). Beer bud allows you to find beers from your favorite breweries, by keyword, and the highest rated beers in our user database. Beer Bud allows you to save and rate your favorite beers to your profile.

The scope of our data is pulled from the BreweryDB API, available at http://www.brewerydb.com/developers
The API has roughly the following volumes of data:
  - Beers: 70,000+ individual beers
  - Breweries: 9500+ individual breweries

The API allows you to page through the data, returning 50 records per page
